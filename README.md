# CanSat_Project

This project aims at conceiving a prototype of a small space exploration probe in order to participate to the 2023 French cansat competition for engineering students.
\
\
The principle of the CanSat is based on the idea of designing a payload similar to that carried by a satellite in a small volume corresponding to a soda can. Originally 33cL, this volume can be increased to 1L. All major satellite systems, such as power, measurement and telemetry, must be designed and integrated into the reduced volume of the CanSat.
The CanSat is launched using a UAV or tethered balloon and performs its missions from launch, during descent, and upon landing.
The proposed missions involve the implementation of scientific experiments from the definition phase to the analysis phase of the collected data.
The objective of the CanSat France competition is to build a CanSat capable of executing the main and secondary missions defined each year. This competition is open to all students regardless of their field of study: engineering school, university, IUT, IUP, BTS.
During one year, the student teams design their CanSat with the support of Planète Sciences and CNES.
The final part of the project is the competition that brings together all the participating teams during the summer at the national C'Space launch campaign, in the presence of representatives from CNES, Planète Sciences and the space industry.
\
\
The goal of the project is to complete several missions in order to earn a maximum amount of points : 
\
\
**Main mission** : Control the trajectory of the probe in order to reach a predetermine GPS position.
\
\
**Secondary mission n°1** : Deploy a structure on the landing of the probe. The surface of the structure should be as large as possible.
\
\
**Secondary mission n°2** : Recognize a QR code on the ground and load the data.
